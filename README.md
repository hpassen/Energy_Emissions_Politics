# Energy, Emissions, and Politics
### A data visualization project exploring the relationships between politics, energy in renewables, and emissions.

The visualizations in this notebook are used in an zine that serves as an oveview of how energy and emissions are related to politics in the United States. The charts drive the narrative of change over time, and display the counterintuitive correlations between renewable energy generation and political parties, demonstrating a factual basis for bipartisan renewable energy policies.
